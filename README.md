Online local tourism management system: This is an online project developed using PHP and MySQL.  The purpose of this project is to promote the local areas. This local tourism website is the first online platform in Pakistan that not only offers the tourism Packages of ventureful areas in Pakistan but also provides its online booking system and knowledge to explore areas for the web surfers. 
We can say that it is an online booking system or platform that provides tourism services for tourist’s ventures in Pakistan. This system is designed and developed only for the tourists and adventurers. 

Through our website, first of all the user has to sign up on our website and book the desired tour package to a specific destination, their trip will be immediately booked upon the approval by the admin of the website. So, we can say that this website initially requires the user to sign up on the website and afterwards be able to use all the facilities provided to their benefit in an efficient way. The system is currently applicable for Tourism in Pakistan. Besides this, this system also maintains the tourists’ records.
Local tourism website is also like a social website. In this website users can give post, tour location and can also get likes and comments from the other users on their post.  

So, in solution of this, the goals of the project of local tourism Services are to provide the users a reliable website that meet their needs urgently. 
Travel and tourism management system is used to book a tour from anywhere in the world by a single dynamic website which will help the user to know all about the places and tour details in a single website. Local tourism is a project to promotes local places in Pakistan. Local tourism works like a social networking sites where tourist look for a new place to go for tourism.
Local tourism is divided into two categorize one is user and the other one is admin. In local tourism, the user first register himself and then he can login to posts and comments. If the user does not register and login, he can only see other user’s posts, tour location in map admin packages and cannot comment or like its posts and cannot also book package for the trip. The users can also cancel the booking package. In local tourism, the user goes to a new place and take a pictures from there and upload it here with title and description. User can comment or likes the posts of other’s user. Users can also do report on the user’s irrelevant post. 
Now coming to admin user, Admin user can handle many things. First is to delete reported posts (in local tourism, a user can report another user post). The reported post is seemed to admin; the admin can delete or ignore the report. 
Second the admin can announce the tour package for user with details. This package is shown to the user in the home page. Any user who is interested applies to the package. This package is limited for few days. if no users cannot book this package. The package will have expired itself.
The admin also sees the registered user that how many users are registered.
The admin can add packages to the website from a certain travel agents and hotels by create a tour page. Then the users can sign in and book each project, they can be confirmed by the admin in them manage booking page. The user can see the confirmation in my booking page. It is an easiest platform for all travelers which can be easily booked and know the all details. Tour Management system is a dynamic website for tourism business.
